        <p>Hypertext Markup Language is a Standard Markup Language for creating Web pages. It 
            uses various tags to structure the content and define the elements on a Webpage.
           <u>Here are some essential concepts and examples to get started with HTML:</u>
            <ul font color="red">
                <li>Headings</li>
                <li>Paragraphs</li>
                <li>links</li>
                <li>Images</li>
                <li>lists</li>
                <li>Comments</li>
            </ul>

        <p>As a Frontend Developer, I have aspirations that can help me grow <b>professionally,
            stay relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry, and contribute to my personal
            and career development.</b> These aspirations include:
            <ol>
                <li>Familiarizing myself with popular Frontend Frameworks like <i>React</i> and
                   <i>Angular</i> which can significantly boost my productivity and make me
                    valuable to employers.
                </li>
                <li>Ensure that I can create responsive and mobile-friendly web applications
                    that work well across different devices and screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Strive to build accessible web applications that can be used by people 
                    with disabilities.
                </li>
                <li>Aim to create web applications that work consistently across different 
                    web browsers.
